/**
 * Generate a unique ID that fits within a long value.  The ID will be unique for the given JVM, and it makes a
 * solid attempt to ensure uniqueness in a clustered environment.  An environment variable <b>JAVA_UTIL_CLUSTERID</b>
 * can be set to a value 0-99 to mark this JVM uniquely in the cluster.  If this environment variable is not set,
 * then hostname, cluster id, and finally a SecureRandom value from 0-99 is chosen for the machine's id within cluster.
 * <br><br>
 * There is an API [getUniqueId()] to get a unique ID that will work through the year 5138.  This API will generate
 * unique IDs at a rate of up to 1 million per second.  There is another API [getUniqueId19()] that will work through
 * the year 2286, however this API will generate unique IDs at a rate up to 10 million per second.  The trade-off is
 * the faster API will generate positive IDs only good for about 286 years [after 2000].<br>
 * <br>
 * The IDs are guaranteed to be strictly increasing.  There is an API you can call (getDate(unique)) that will return
 * the date and time (to the millisecond) that the ID was created.
